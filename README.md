# ğŸ©º Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on various medical attributes. It aims to assist early detection and improve the diagnostic process using automated, data-driven methods.

## ğŸ“Š Problem Statement

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women globally. Early and accurate diagnosis can significantly increase survival rates. This project uses clinical features from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses to predict the diagnosis outcome.
